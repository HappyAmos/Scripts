# Scripts
Various BASH scripts, conky configs, Linux Mint extensions/actions/desklets/etc.
Feel free to use these as you wish. I released them under the MIT License which I think is pretty flexible, but can change it to something more
flexible upon request. If you would like to modify any of these, such as the pi bash/conky configs feel free to send a pull request.

Files:
  <p>myconky.conf: Custom conky script to display some really basic info on the desktop such as time and basic network info, including local and remote IP numbers.</p>
  <p>pi: a bash script to retrieve some basic information from a local Raspberry Pi. Could be used for any server or other Linux machine.</p>
  <p>pi1.conf: a conky configuration file to display information from the pi script above.</p>
